**While Recording**
- Always pause and reset your expression before starting recording
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Don't worry about mistakes
- When you make mistakes, just pause, make your reset gesture, and then reset screen/code/whatever needed to continue
- Before you continue after a mistake, pause and reset your expression for a smooth transition during the edit phase (makes editing easier/faster).
- Go ahead and ad lib stuff if it comes to you. You can always edit it out, if it doesn't work.
